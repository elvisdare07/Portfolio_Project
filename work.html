                <h2>About The Project</h2>
                <p>Chexy is a platform that currently allows users to pay rent with their credit cards and receive cashback rewards for making rent payments. In addition, the platform allows users to build credit without having to take on additional debt when rent payments usually take up the majority of pay cheques.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For this specific version, we're looking to improve and build out the landlord side of the platform with the following features. </p>

                    <button class="accordion-button">01. Feature Dumping</button>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>We kick started our design process by researching common property management/automation tools that are currently on the market. After doing an in depth evaluation of 8 other competitors in the space, we started taking apart each feature from the 8 competitors' platforms. After we have a bank of features, we gathered the list of features that we think our target audience could benefit from. </p>

                        <p>Once we decided the features we would like to build out for this version, we categorized in "low priority", "medium priority", and "high priority".</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>We want to obtain an unbiased perspective of what landlords want and need. Collectively, we scoured the web looking for common struggled that small to medium sized landlords go through as part of their day to day operations. After sifting through all the gathered "user stories", we began draft all of our assumptions of how a landlord might want to use the features we gathered. </p>
                        <p>After we recorded our assumptions, we then assigned relevant features to each of our assumptions. Which is then categorized again into "low priority", "medium priority", "high priority", which would give us an idea of which features to develop and validate first. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>With our long list of assumptions and features for each assumption, we went ahead to contact landlord of various sizes. </p>
                        <p>Summary of pain points: </p>
                        <p>Hard to report rental income for tax purposes because of poor visibility on payments 
                        <br>Hard to know which tenant has paid and which hasn't when landlord has numerous units.
                        <br>Managing rent deposits and increases is difficult because of poor systems to track payments over time. 
                        <br> My tenants sometimes forget to pay rent...it would be nice to have reminders and even better if there is automation. 
                        <br>Depositing cheques isn't ideal but the additional control they afford is enjoyed by some </p>

                        <p>After we validated our assumptions and finalized our features in order of priority, we started the design process of initial wireframes and userflows.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>We finalized the designs by creating interactive prototypes which we successfully tested with 27 landlords with a combined total of 4000+ units. Our results were as expected, so a final audit by the legal team was done before we handed off to engineers.</p>

                <h2>The Research Findings</h2>
                <p>Our research process consisted of face to face and zoom interviews where we asked landlords about their current process, what could be improved about their process, and presenting our solutions in a figma prototype.</p>

                        <p>The landlords we interviewed all have access to a bank account that have pre-built iframes we can embed on Chexy. Connecting bank accounts would be a matter of just entering direct deposit information, or logging in with a username and password.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>It was established during our interview session that Landlords prefer sticking to the old method of payment, which is often direct deposit. Given that our target demographi is small to medium landlords, the larger landlords would prefer receiving all their payments in the same form. While smaller landlords don't mind if they receive their payments through cheques, bank transfers, etransfers, or cash.</p>

                        <p>Majority of the landlords we interviewed showed interest in having their tenants' rent payments reported to credit bureaus. We explained the idea behind "building credit without taking on debt" which landlords thought was interesting and was not opposed to it.</p>

                        <p>Although Chexy's sign up and onboarding process can be long, institutional landlords don't seem to mind because they would prefer to have a centralized platform to manage all their rental invoices and be able to track their payments.</p>
                        <p>Institutional landlords: Have 100+ units and in some cases have adoption of property management software to drive efficiency, also indicated interest in paying a nominal fee to use Chexy services.</p>
