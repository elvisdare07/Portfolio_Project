                <h2>About The Project</h2>
                <p>Chexy is a platform that currently allows users to pay rent with their credit cards and receive cashback rewards for making rent payments. In addition, the platform allows users to build credit without having to take on additional debt when rent payments usually take up the majority of pay cheques.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For this specific version, we're looking to improve and build out the landlord side of the platform. Our main business goals would be to encourage landlords to manage their properties and payments through the Chexy platform. However, we need to provide enough value propositiion to give landlords a reason to modify their current process.</p>

            <div class="work-section">
                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <p>I was the only product designer actively working on this release and I worked closely with the Chief of Product to make sure my designs meet requirements. The Chief of Product primarly fed me information such as research findings and user stories. </p>

            <div class="work-section">
                <h2>Design Focus</h2>
                <p>How might we create a landlord centric platform that allows landlords to seamlessly manage their properties and collect payments?  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="work-section">
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>Sole proprieter landlords and midsized corporation landlords. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="work-section">
                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <button class="accordion-button" aria-expanded="false">01. Feature Dumping</button>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>We kick started our design process by researching common property management/automation tools that are currently on the market. After doing an in depth evaluation of 8 other competitors in the space, we started taking apart each feature from the 8 competitors' platforms. After we have a bank of features, we gathered the list of features that we think our target audience could benefit from. </p>

                        <p>Once we decided the features we would like to build out for this version, we categorized in "low priority", "medium priority", and "high priority".</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <button class="accordion-button" aria-expanded="false">02. Eliminate Biases & Record Assumptions</button>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>We want to obtain an unbiased perspective of what landlords want and need. Collectively, we scoured the web looking for common struggled that small to medium sized landlords go through as part of their day to day operations. After sifting through all the gathered "user stories", we began draft all of our assumptions of how a landlord might want to use the features we gathered. </p>
                        <p>After we recorded our assumptions, we then assigned relevant features to each of our assumptions. Which is then categorized again into "low priority", "medium priority", "high priority", which would give us an idea of which features to develop and validate first. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-item">

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>With our long list of assumptions and features for each assumption, we went ahead to contact landlord of various sizes. </p>
                        <p>Summary of pain points: </p>
                        <p>Hard to report rental income for tax purposes because of poor visibility on payments 
                        <br>Hard to know which tenant has paid and which hasn't when landlord has numerous units.
                        <br>Managing rent deposits and increases is difficult because of poor systems to track payments over time. 
                        <br> My tenants sometimes forget to pay rent...it would be nice to have reminders and even better if there is automation. 
                        <br>Depositing cheques isn't ideal but the additional control they afford is enjoyed by some </p>

                        <p>We finalized the designs by creating interactive prototypes which we successfully tested with 27 landlords. Our results were as expected, so a final audit was done to ensure we met regulatory standards for collecting lease information. </p>

                <p>Our research process consisted of face to face and zoom interviews where we asked landlords about their current process, what could be improved about their process, and presenting our solutions in a figma prototype.</p>

                        <p>The landlords we interviewed all have access to a bank account that have pre-built iframes we can embed on Chexy. Connecting bank accounts would be a matter of just entering direct deposit information, or logging in with a username and password.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>It was established during our interview session that Landlords prefer sticking to the old method of payment, which is often direct deposit. Given that our target demographi is small to medium landlords, the larger landlords would prefer receiving all their payments in the same form. While smaller landlords don't mind if they receive their payments through cheques, bank transfers, etransfers, or cash.</p>

                        <p>Majority of the landlords we interviewed showed interest in having their tenants' rent payments reported to credit bureaus. We explained the idea behind "building credit without taking on debt" which landlords thought was interesting and was not opposed to it.</p>

                        <p>Although Chexy's sign up and onboarding process can be long, institutional landlords don't seem to mind because they would prefer to have a centralized platform to manage all their rental invoices and be able to track their payments.</p>
                        <p>Institutional landlords: Have 100+ units and in some cases have adoption of property management software to drive efficiency, also indicated interest in paying a nominal fee to use Chexy services.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>The scope of this project was quite large to begin with. But after settings our biases and assumptions aside, we were able to narrow down the scope based on which assumptions we validated. </p>
                    <p>With the number of features we originally proposed, nearly half of those features have been removed. An important lesson that I learned is that we cannot design for every user and every edgecase. The main challenge we faced was with goals and needs of our different target audiences. We slowly realized that there are different skill levels when it comes to real estate investing regardless of sole proprieter or corporations. Some smaller landlords are experienced, some are inexperienced, but how can we bridge the gap between all the skill levels?  </p>
                    <p>At the end of the day, we learned various interviewing techniques and vocabulary to use with each target audience. And now moving forward, we have a better idea of what we can improve on for the next release.</p>
